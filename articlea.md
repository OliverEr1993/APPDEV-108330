### Membership
According to the [Python Website](https://www.python.org/psf/membership-faq/) there are 5 types of memberships:
1. **Basic Members:** Basic members are individuals or entities who are part of the Python language community and who have decided to declare their support for Python and agree to the community Code of Conduct. There is no cost to be a Basic Member.
2. **Supporting Members:** Supporting Members make a specific annual donation to the PSF to sustain the Foundation and support the Python community. Supporting Members are eligible to vote. You may combine Supporting Membership with any other Membership - i.e. you may sign up for Supporting Membership and also be a Basic, Managing, or Contributing Member or a Fellow.
3. **Managing Members:** Managing Members are people who dedicate at least five hours per month working to support the Python ecosystem - by organizing Python events, managing or contributing to PSF projects, running infrastructure, participating in one of the PSF's working groups, etc. Managing Members are eligible to vote. There is no cost to be a Managing Member. 
4. **Contributing Member:** Contributing Members are people who dedicate at least five hours per month working on projects that advance the mission of the PSF, where the work relates to the creation or maintenance of open source software available to the public at no charge. Contributing Members are eligible to vote. There is no cost to be a Contributing Member. 
5. **Fellows:** Fellows are members who have been nominated for their extraordinary efforts and impact upon Python, the community, and the broader Python ecosystem. Fellows are nominated from the broader community and elevated by a vote of the members. Fellow members are eligible to vote.

# Why Python is Popular
---
Python is a popular programming language for many reasons. Some of the key features that make
it so attractive to programmers include:
- **Easy to learn:** Python has a simple, easy-to-read syntax that is perfect for beginners. The
language is designed to be intuitive and easy to understand, so even those with no
programming experience can start coding quickly.
- **Versatile:** Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications,
including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
- **Large community:** Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to
the language and its many libraries. This means that there is a wealth of resources and support
available for those who want to learn and use Python.
- **Open source:** Python is open-source software, which means that it is free to use and
distribute. This makes it an ideal choice for those who want to create and share their own
projects without incurring any costs.

# Application of Python
---
Python is widely used in many different fields, such as:
1. **Web Development:** Python is often used as the backend language for web applications,
thanks to its powerful libraries such as Django and Flask.
2. **Data Science and Machine Learning:** Python has a wide range of powerful libraries, such as
NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, which make it easy to perform data analysis and machine
learning tasks.
3. **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics:** Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras make it
easy to build and train neural networks, allowing developers to create intelligent systems that
can learn and make decisions.
4. **Finance, Education and Gaming:** Many organizations use Python for tasks such as
automating financial transactions, creating educational software, and building games.
5. **GIS:** Python is a widely used programming language in the field of Geographic Information
Systems (GIS), it is commonly used to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex analyses,
and create custom tools for working with GIS data.

# Getting Started with Python
---
To get started with Python, you will need to download and install the Python software. You can
download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads). Once you have installed Python, you can start writing and running code.

To write code in Python, you can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
Some popular IDEs for Python include IDLE (the built-in Python IDE), PyCharm, and Visual Studio
Code.
## Python Libraries
___
Python has a wide range of libraries available that provide additional functionality for different
tasks. Some of the most popular libraries include:
| Library | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **NumPy** | A library for working with arrays and matrices. |
| **Pandas** | A library for working with data frames and data analysis. |
| **Matplotlib** | A library for creating visualizations and plots. |
| **Scikit-learn** | A library for machine learning and data mining.|

## Python Functions
___
Python functions are blocks of code that can be reused multiple times. A function is defined using
the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and set of parantheses. The code inside the function is executed when the fuction is called.
For example, the following code defines a function called greet that prints a message:
```sh
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
greet("John")
```
When the code is run, it will print "Hello, John".

### Built-in Functions
Python has a variety of built-in functions that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such
as:
| Function | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **print()** | The `print` function is used to display output to the console. |
| **len()** | The `len` function is used to find the length of a string or a list. |
| **str()** | The `str` function is used to convert a value to a string. |
| **int()** | The `int` function is used to convert a value to an integer. |
| **min()** | The `min` function is used to find the minimum value in a list or a string. |
| **max()** | The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in a list or a string. |

# Conclusion
---
Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that is widely used in many different fields.
Its simple, easy-to-read syntax makes it an ideal choice for beginners and experts alike, and its
large community of developers ensures that there is always support and resources available. With
a wide range of libraries available for different tasks, Python is a versatile choice for any
programmer.
As the famous computer scientist, Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, said:
> Python is an easy-to-use programming language for people who want to express concepts in
code. It has a simple syntax, large community, and vast libraries for a variety of tasks. That's
why I love it.
